Let’s start **DAY 1 (Monday)** properly — **step by step**, zero skip.

## 🟢 **DAY 1 – C++ Basics & Program Structure**

### 📌 What is C++?

* C++ is a **compiled**, **fast**, **general-purpose** language
* Used in:

  * Competitive Programming
  * Game Engines
  * Operating Systems
  * DSA & System Design

---

### 📌 Structure of a C++ Program

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World";
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation:

* `#include <iostream>` → input/output library
* `using namespace std;` → avoid writing `std::cout`
* `int main()` → program execution starts here
* `cout` → output
* `return 0;` → program ended successfully

---

### 📌 Output in C++

```cpp
cout << "Hello Dawood";
cout << 10;
cout << 5 + 3;
```

---

### 📌 Input in C++

```cpp
int age;
cin >> age;
```

Multiple inputs:

```cpp
int a, b;
cin >> a >> b;
```

---

### 📌 Comments

```cpp
// Single line comment

/* Multi
   line
   comment */
```

---

## 🧠 **DAY 1 Practice Tasks (Must Do)**

### ✅ Task 1: Print Info

```cpp
Name: Dawood
Age: 20
```

---

### ✅ Task 2: Sum of Two Numbers

Input:

```
5 7
```

Output:

```
Sum = 12
```

---

### ✅ Task 3: Simple Message Program

```cpp
Welcome to C++ Programming
```

---

## ❓ Quick Check (Answer in Your Mind)

1. Where does C++ execution start?
2. Why do we use `return 0;`?
3. Difference between `cout` and `cin`?

---

## 🎯 Day 1 Goal

✔ Understand program structure
✔ Learn input/output
✔ Write at least **3 programs yourself**
